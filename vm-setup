started with a kubuntu vm in Hyper-V (1 core, 1gb ram, 25gb hd space [probably over kill]) and did a full install, then updated and upgraded
installed git
ran "git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole.git Pi-hole"    ******(look at the other heavily asterisked line before running this command)
ran into an issue with FTL not being installed so i edited etc/resolv.conf changed nameserver from 127.0.0.53 to 8.8.8.8 ("sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf" changed the numbers then ctrl-x, Y, enter to update the file) then ran "pihole -r"
technically it was running but it wasn't doing anything (verified by doing an nslookup to doubleclick.com - which should have given me an address of my pihole, but didn't)
restarted VM, started up pihole and restarted DNS (sudo pihole restartdns) then checked that the service was running "pihole status" which showed no issues
still can't access the webinterface
ran debug "pihole -d" which showed the following errors:
    failed to resolve via localhost 127.0.0.1
    failed to resolve via Pi-hole 192.168.1.2
    lighttpd daemon is failed
i'm able to effectly dig google's dns servers ("dig google.com @127.0.0.1" & "dig google.com @8.8.8.8") & pihole-FTL is running on the correct ports - tcp&udp 53 (check via "sudo netstat -tulpn") so there's probably no firewall or port assigment issues
verified the dnsamsq is not running ("sudo service dnsmasq status -l") and that there's an issue with lighttpd ("sudo service lighttpd status -l")
"sudo netstat -nltup | grep 'Proto\|:53 \|:67 \|:80 \|:471'" appears to show all of the appropriate pihole-FTL services running on the right ports
*****************after digging around for awhile i've determined the issue is with lighttpd and the basic install script, so i did (the potentially unsafe) curl -L install.pi-hole.net | bash
this installed everything properly, howeveer, i'm still not blocking ads (i think)
nslookup for doubleclick.com gives it no address which is a good sign but i'm still seeing ads on some sites
"pihole restartdns" resolved the issue, i can now access the web interface and verified that it's blocking adverts on the VM
